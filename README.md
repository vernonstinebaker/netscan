# netscan

A modern network scanning utility for Apple platforms, built with Swift and SwiftUI.

This application is designed to discover devices and services on your local network. It provides a clean and simple interface to visualize network information.

## Features

*   **Local Network Scanning:** Discovers active hosts on the local network.
*   **Service Discovery:** Uses Bonjour and SSDP to find services advertised by devices.
*   **Ping Utility:** Includes functionality to ping devices using ICMP.
*   **Modern UI:** Built with SwiftUI for a responsive and modern user experience across all target platforms.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Swift
*   **UI:** SwiftUI
*   **Networking:** Primarily uses Apple's `Network` framework and includes components built with `SwiftNIO` for low-level network tasks.

## Getting Started

To build and run this project:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vernonstinebaker/netscan.git
    ```
2.  Open the project in Xcode:
    ```bash
    cd netscan
    xed .
    ```
3.  Select a target (iOS or macOS) and run the application.

### iOS Checklist (Bonjour/Local Network)

To enable discovery features on iOS, ensure the following:

- Info.plist keys
  - `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`: A user-facing string explaining why the app needs local network access.
  - `NSBonjourServices`: Array of service types you plan to browse (e.g., `_http._tcp.`, `_ssh._tcp.`, etc.). If you use dynamic DNS‑SD type discovery, include the superset of types your app may browse.
- Entitlements
  - If using multicast networking features (e.g., certain SSDP/WS‑Discovery scenarios), add the Multicast Networking entitlement to your iOS provisioning profile.
- Notes
  - ARP parsing and ICMP via `/sbin/ping` are macOS‑only; on iOS, the app falls back to TCP‑based discovery and Bonjour/SSDP.
  - On first launch, iOS will prompt the user to allow Local Network access.
