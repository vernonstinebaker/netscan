## üöÄ NEXT STEPS: Advanced Features & Polish

### 6. Enhanced Device Detection

- [x] **MAC Address Vendor Lookup:**
  - ‚úÖ OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) database bundled and parsed
  - ‚úÖ Vendor identification integrated with ARP MAC parsing
  - ‚úÖ In‚Äëmemory vendor cache for performance
- [x] **Service Detection Enhancement:**
  - ‚úÖ Improve service name detection accuracy (central ServiceMapper; port‚Äëbased mapping)
  - ‚è≥ Version detection for common services
  - ‚è≥ Service fingerprinting
- [x] **Device Type Classification:**
  - ‚úÖ Initial rules using hostname/vendor/ports
  - ‚è≥ Add capability/OS detection depth and confidence scoring

### 7. Performance & Reliability

- [x] **Scanning Optimization:**
  - ‚úÖ Implement concurrent port scanning with proper limits (32 concurrent connections)
  - ‚úÖ Add scan progress tracking and cancellation support
  - ‚úÖ Optimize network discovery with skipIPs to avoid redundant scanning
  - [ ] Add advanced performance tuning options
- [ ] **Caching & Persistence:**
  - ‚è≥ Persist device information between scans via SwiftData integration
  - ‚è≥ Add scan history and comparison features
- [ ] **Error Handling & Recovery:**
  - Improve error handling for network timeouts
  - Add retry logic for failed scans
  - Implement graceful degradation for partial failures

### 8. User Experience Enhancements

- [x] **Advanced Filtering & Search:**
  - ‚úÖ Implement search (name, IP, vendor, hostname, MAC, services)
  - ‚úÖ Add filters (online only, device type, discovery source)
  - ‚è≥ Vendor‚Äëspecific filter and custom device grouping
- [ ] **Device Details Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Add "Complete Port Scan" action to scan all 65535 ports (with progress indicator)
  - [ ] Show detailed port scan results with service identification
  - [ ] Add port scan history and comparison features
- [ ] **Export & Reporting:**
  - Export scan results to CSV/JSON
  - Generate network topology reports

## üîß 2025-09-08 Work Log (Ongoing)

This section tracks incremental fixes and tests as they land.

- [x] **Phase 1 Optimization**: Removed low-value discovery methods (NTPDiscoverer, NetBIOSDiscoverer) to focus on home network use cases
- [x] **Phase 2 Optimization**: Implemented tiered discovery system with reduced timeouts and improved performance
  - [x] Tier 1: Fast methods (Bonjour + ARP) with 3.0s timeout
  - [x] Tier 2: Medium methods (SSDP + WS-Discovery) with 2.0-3.0s timeout
  - [x] Immediate device updates and service scanning when devices are discovered
- [x] **Tiered Service Scanning**: Prioritized common home network ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, DNS, Telnet first)
- [x] **KV Store Integration**: Load previous scan data first, then immediately check device online status
- [x] **Swift 6 Compatibility**: Fixed main actor isolation warnings for NetworkService creation and debugLog calls
- [x] Fix: Preserve/merge `openPorts` in `ScanViewModel.updateDevice` instead of overwriting. Add unit tests for port/service merge semantics. (2025-09-04)
- [x] Improve: Service mapping accuracy
  - [x] `BonjourCollector.mapServiceType` returns `.unknown` for unmapped types
  - [x] Use `ServiceCatalog.entry(forPort:)` in Port-derived mapping and UI
  - [x] Unit tests for mapping by port and mDNS type
- [x] UX: Distinguish services by port and show it in pills (e.g., HTTP:8080). Avoid merging different ports under one service type. (2025-09-04)
- [x] Relax: Remove `.wifi` interface requirement in `NetworkFrameworkProber`
  - [x] Add smoke test that `probe` returns `.dead` for invalid IP (no network needed)
- [x] Reliability: Make per-host port scans cancellable via DI in `ScanViewModel`
  - [x] Inject `portScannerFactory` and track child tasks; cancel on `cancelScan()`
  - [x] Unit tests using a fake scanner to verify cancellation and state cleanup
- [x] Polish: Gate noisy logs under `#if DEBUG` for Bonjour, SSDP, OUI (selective), scanners
- [x] Tests: Updated and added unit tests for mapping, merging, prober, WS‚ÄëDiscovery parsing, filtering; full suite runs clean
